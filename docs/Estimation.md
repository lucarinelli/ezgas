# Estimation approach

Consider the EZGas  project as described in requirement document, this is an estimate plan for the project.
We considered to use Java Language with Spring Framework.
Group are about 4 developer working in parallel.

# Estimate by product decomposition



### 


|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |        33                     |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                58            | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1914 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 192                                     |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 5760 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  2                  |
