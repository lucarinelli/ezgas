Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things

1. Gain experience in the development flow using git
2. Use of mainstream framework (Spring) and language (Java)
3. Remote working and tools for that (effective communication, GitLab issues,
Telegram, Slack, Skype, Zoom)
4. Project was about a web application

# Worst things

1. Interaction with the professor, Slack has been kind of ok but communication
in person would probably have been better. A more structured interaction in using
communication tools could have worked too.
2. Not so clear requirements for parts of the projects and deliverables
3. Not to use SpringTest for controller testing was very uncomfortable
4. Coordination of the group would have been easier in presence probably
5. Little space for creativity when dealing with design and requirements

# Suggestions

* **Provide a more organized way to interact with the professors**
* A laboratory hour to ask questions about the project could have been useful
* Use what is provided by the framework whenever is possible to ease interaction
among the components
* Effort in testing is not measured in the dashboard and skews the productivity
